I’ve been thinking for such a long time but couldn’t make a decision on publishing my random thoughts in english. First reason is that I cannot construct english articles very well, even if I am a teeny-tiny english debater. But that has nothing to do that I cay easily be an good english writer, right? Second reason is that I was hesitating about what I’m going to write for my first essay. Today, I, accidentally, encountered with an essay about the Minority and I feel like it’s the right time for me to do my first post. 
What we talk about when we talk about the **minority**?
