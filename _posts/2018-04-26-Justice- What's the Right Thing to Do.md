### 1. DOING THE RIGHT THING
####  A. Welfare, Freedom, and Virtue 
> maximizing welfare, respecting freedom, and promoting virtue.
1. Welfare & Freedom
	2. **Opp to price-gouging laws**
		- markets promote the welfare of society as a whole by providing incentives for people to work hard supplying the goods that other people want.
		-  markets respect individual freedom; rather than impose a certain value on goods and services, markets let people choose for themselves what value to place on the things they exchange.
	2. **Pro to price-gouging laws**
		- the welfare of society as whole is not really served by the exorbitant prices charged in hard times.
		 - under certain conditions, the free market is not truly free.
1. Virtue: greed is a vice that the state should discourage.
#### B. Three Approaches to Justice
> To ask whether a society is just is to ask how it distributes the things we prize———income and wealth, duties and rights, powers and opportunities, offices and honors.
* *Maximizing welfare*
	* Why? we think prosperity makes us better off than we would otherwise be—as individuals and as a society. Prosperity matters, in other words, because it contributes to our welfare.
* *Respecting freedom*
	* respecting freedom and individual rights is at least as familiar in contemporary politics as the utilitarian idea of maximizing welfare.
* *Promoting virtue*
	* giving people what they morally deserve—allocating goods to reward and promote virtue.
#### C. Moral Dilemmas
* Life in democratic societies is rife with disagreement about right and wrong, justice and injustice.
* One way to begin is to notice how moral reflection emerges naturally from an encounter with a hard moral question.
* Plato’s point is that to grasp the meaning of justice and the nature of the good life, we must rise above the prejudices and routines of everyday life.

### 2. THE GREATEST HAPPINESS PRINCIPLE / UTILITARIANISM
#### A. Life boat Case
1. the morality of an action depends solely on the consequences it brings about; the right thing to do is whatever will produce the best state of affairs, all things considered.
2. consequences are not all we should care about, morally speaking; certain duties and rights should command our respect, for reasons independent of the social consequences.
#### B. Jeremy Bentham’s Utilitarianism
* The highest principle of morality is to **maximize happiness, the overall balance of pleasure over pain.** According to Bentham, the right thing to do is whatever will maximize utility. By “utility,” he means whatever produces pleasure or happiness, and whatever prevents pain or suffering.
#### C. Rounding up beggars
> Any citizen who encountered a beggar would be empowered to apprehend him and take him to the nearest workhouse. Once confined there, each beggar would have to work to pay off the cost of his or her maintenance, which would be tallied in a “self-liberation account.” The account would include food, clothing, bedding, medical care, and a life insurance policy, in case the beggar died before the account was paid up. To give citizens an incentive to take the trouble to apprehend beggars and deliver them to the workhouse, Bentham proposed a reward of twenty shillings per apprehension—to be added, of course, to the beggar’s tab.
- **Objection 1: Individual Rights**: By caring only about the sum of satisfactions, it can run roughshod over individual people. For the utilitarian, individuals matter, but only in the sense that each person’s preferences should be counted along with everyone else’s.
#### D. Is torture ever justified?
- **Practical(Opp)**: it seldom works, since information extracted under duress is often unreliable. So pain is inflicted, but the community is not made any safer: there is no increase in the collective utility.
- **Principle(Opp)**: it violates human rights and fails to respect the intrinsic dignity of human beings. Their case against torture does not depend on utilitarian considerations. They argue that human rights and human dignity have a moral basis that lies beyond utility.
- **Objection 2: A Common Currency of Value**: 
	* Utilitarianism claims to offer a science of morality, based on measuring, aggregating, and calculating happiness.
	* Everyone’s preferences count equally.
	* all values can’t be captured by a common currency of value.
		* How to solve? *Cost-benefit Analysis*  
			Bring rationality and rigor to complex social choices by translating all costs and benefits into monetary terms —and then comparing them.
#### E. The benefits of lung cancer
> although smokers impose higher medical costs on the budget while they are alive, they die early, and so save the government considerable sums in health care, pensions, and housing for the elderly.
* A fuller *Cost-benefit analysis* would add to the moral calculus an amount representing the cost of dying early for the smoker and his family, and would weigh these against the savings the smoker’s early death would provide the government.

#### F. Exploding gas tanks
* the overall benefit of the safety improvement(with fatalities) \> the cost of adding an $11 device to 12.5 million vehicles
* **To measure the full effect on utility of a traffic fatality, one would have to include the victim’s loss of future happiness, not only lost earnings and funeral costs.**

#### G. John Stuart Mill
* **Principle:** people should be free to do whatever they want, provided they do no harm to others.
* The higher pleasures are not higher because we prefer them; we prefer them because we recognize them as higher. We judge Hamlet as great art not because we like it more than lesser entertainments, but because it engages our highest faculties and makes us more fully human.
* **His Contribution:** Mill saves utilitarianism from the charge that it reduces everything to a crude calculus of pleasure and pain, but only by invoking a moral ideal of human dignity and personality independent of utility itself.

### 3. DO WE OWN OURSELVES? /LIBERTARIANISM
#### A. The Minimal State
> one that enforces contracts, protects private property from theft, and keeps the peace.

Objections to Modern States:
1. No Paternalism. Libertarians oppose laws to protect people from harming themselves.
2. No Morals Legislation. Libertarians oppose using the coercive force of law to promote notions of virtue or to express the moral convictions of the majority.
3. No Redistribution of Income or Wealth. The libertarian theory of rights rules out any law that requires some people to help others, including taxation for redistribution of wealth.

#### B. Free-Market Philosophy
1. whether the resources you used to make your money were legitimately yours in the first place. (If you made a fortune selling stolen goods, you would not be entitled to the proceeds.)
2. whether you made your money either through free exchanges in the marketplace or from gifts voluntarily bestowed upon you by others.
3. **If the answer to both questions is yes, you are entitled to what you have, and the state may not take it without your consent. **

#### C. Michael Jordan’s Money
> Seizing the results of someone’s labor is equivalent to seizing hours from him and directing him to carry on various activities. If people force you to do certain work, or unrewarded work, for a certain period of time, they decide what you are to do and what purposes your work is to serve apart from your decisions. This… makes them** a part-owner of you;** it gives them a property right in you.
1. The idea of **self-ownership**. If I own myself, I must **own my labor**. (If someone else could order me to work, that person would be my master, and I would be a slave.) But if I own my labor, I must **be entitled to the fruits of my labor**. (If someone else were entitled to my earnings, that person would own my labor and would therefore own me.)
#### Do We Own Ourselves?
1. Objection 1: Taxation is not as bad as forced labor. If you are taxed, you can always choose to work less and pay lower taxes; but if you are forced to labor, you have no such choice.
	2. Libertarian reply: why should the state force you to make that choice?
3. Objection 2: The poor need the money more.
	4. Libertarian reply: Maybe so. But this is a reason to persuade the affluent to support the needy through their own free choice. **It does not justify forcing Jordan and Gates to give to charity.** Stealing from the rich and giving to the poor is still stealing, whether it’s done by Robin Hood or the state.
##### Selling kidneys
1. notion of self-ownership: If I own my own body, I should be free to sell my body parts as I please. 
##### Assisted suicide
1. If my life belongs to me, I should be free to give it up. And if I enter into a voluntary agreement with someone to help me die, the state has no right to interfere.
##### Consensual cannibalism

### 4. HIRED HELP / MARKETS AND MORALS
Libertarian and Utilitarian
1. Libertarian(Freedom): letting people engage in voluntary exchanges **respects their freedom**
2. Utilitarian(Welfare): free markets promote the general welfare; when two people make a deal, both gain. **As long as their deal makes them better off without hurting anyone else, it must increase overall utility.**
#### A. What’s Just—Drafting Soldiers or Hiring Them?
1. Conscription
	- Libertarian(Opp): coercive, a form of slavery.
	- Utilitarian(Opp): limits people’s choices, and therefore reduces overall happiness.
2. Conscription allowing paid substitutes (Civil War system)
	- Utilitarian(Prop): The freedom to enter into the exchange seems to increase each party’s utility without reducing anyone else’s. 
3. **Market system (volunteer army)**
	- Libertarian(Prop): Freedom of choice
	- Utilitarian(Opp): the increased happiness of better-paid soldiers would be offset by the unhappiness of taxpayers who now pay more for military service.(not convincing)
	- **Objection1: Fairness and freedom**: the free market is not all that free(coercion): homeless don’t like but they have to survive.
		- Opp: no society is perfectly equal. So the risk of coercion always hovers over the choices people make in the labor market.
	- **Objection 2: Civic virtue and the common good**: all citizens have a duty to serve their country as their civic responsibility. Turning military service into a commodity corrupts the civic ideals that should govern it.
#### B.Pregnancy for Pay
Rejection to the surrogacy contract
1. The consent was flawed. Mary Beth’s agreement to bear a child and surrender it at birth was not truly voluntary
2. Commercial surrogacy amounts to baby-selling
#### C. Surrogacy Contracts and Justice
> Mary Beth(Egg&Womb) + William Stern(Sperm)
- **Objection 1: Tainted consent**: whether it’s voluntary as the conditions under which people make choices.
- **Objection 2: Degradation and higher goods**: treating babies and pregnancy as commodities degrades them, or fails to value them appropriately.
	- Why degradation? treating their bodies as factories and by paying them not to bond with the children they bear.  Example: Treating human being as commodities is wrong. That’s because human beings are persons worthy of respect, not objects to be used.
	- **Judging modes of valuation**
		1. freedom: human beings are capable of freedom, we shouldn’t be used as if we were mere objects, but should be treated instead with dignity and respect.
		2. the purposes and ends those practices serve: “the social practices of pregnancy rightly **promote” a certain end**, namely **an emotional bond of a mother with her child.** A contract that requires the mother not to form such a bond is degrading because it diverts her from this end. It replaces a “norm of parenthood” with a “norm of commercial production.”
#### D. Outsourcing Pregnancy
> Traditional: egg-bundled-with-womb.   
> New technology: IVF(in vitro fertilization). egg, womb, sperm can come from different individuals
#### E. Questions
1. How free are the choices we make in the free market? 
2. Are there certain virtues and higher goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?

### 5. WHAT MATTERS IS THE MOTIVE / IMMANUEL KANT
#### A. The Trouble with Maximizing Happiness/ Why Utilitarians are wrong
1. **morality can’t be based on merely empirical considerations, such as the interests, wants, desires, and preferences people have at any given time.** Basing moral principles on preferences and desires—even the desire for happiness—misunderstands what morality is about. The utilitarian’s happiness principle “contributes nothing whatever toward establishing morality, **since making a man happy is quite different from making him good and making him prudent or astute in seeking his advantage quite different from making him virtuous.”**
2. every person is worthy of respect, because we are rational beings, capable of reason; we are also autonomous beings, capable of acting and choosing freely.

#### B. What Is Freedom?
Kant’s view
1. I’m trying to decide what flavor of ice cream to order: Should I go for chocolate, vanilla, or espresso toffee crunch? I may think of myself as exercising freedom of choice, but what I’m really doing is trying to figure out which flavor will best satisfy my preferences—preferences I didn’t choose in the first place. Kant doesn’t say it’s wrong to satisfy our preferences. His point is that, **when we do so, we are not acting freely, but acting according to a determination given outside us.**
2. Whenever my behavior is biologically determined or socially conditioned, it is not truly free. **To act freely, according to Kant, is to act autonomously. And to act autonomously is to act according to a law I give myself—not according to the dictates of nature or social convention.**
4. Act heteronomously: I fall (or am pushed) from the Empire State Building. As I hurtle toward the earth, no one would say that I am acting freely; **my movement is governed by the law of gravity**. Since there is no autonomy, there can be **no moral responsibility.**
5. **To act freely** is not to choose the best means to a given end; it **is to choose the end itself, for its own sake—a choice that human beings can make and billiard balls (and most animals) cannot.**

#### C. Persons and Things
1. Capacity to act autonomously is what gives human life its special dignity. It marks out the difference between persons and things.
2. **Respecting human dignity means treating persons as ends in themselves.** This is why it is wrong to use people for the sake of the general welfare, as utilitarianism does.

#### D. What’s Moral? Look for the Motive
1. The moral worth of an action consists not in the consequences that flow from it, but in the intention from which the act is done. **What matters is the motive, and the motive must be of a certain kind. What matters is doing the right thing because it’s right, not for some ulterior motive.**
2. **Duty vs Inclination**
	3. Acts of Duty - the only genuine examples of morally good behavior. 
	4. Acts of Inclination - usually amoral (neither good nor bad) unless performing an inclined act is done at the expense of a morally good dutiful one, in which case it would be immoral. 
3. Doing something because it’s right, not because it’s useful or convenient —confers moral worth on an action.
